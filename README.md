# Virtual-Scroll-App

Overview
The Virtual Scroll application demonstrates the use of virtual scrolling to efficiently render a large list of items by loading only a subset of items into the DOM. This helps improve performance and user experience by reducing the number of DOM nodes rendered at any time.

Architecture
Frontend
React: The application uses React for building the user interface.
react-window: A library for efficiently rendering large lists and tabular data.
axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch data from the server.
Jest: Used for unit testing the components and functionality.
Backend
Express: The backend server is built using Express to handle HTTP requests.
Cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
Simulated Network Delay: The server simulates a network delay to mimic real-world scenarios.
Implementation
Frontend
VirtualScroll Component (src/VirtualScroll.jsx):

Imports:

useState, useEffect: For managing state and side effects.
FixedSizeList from react-window: For virtualizing the list.
AutoSizer from react-virtualized-auto-sizer: To automatically adjust the size of the list.
State Management:

items: Holds the list of items fetched from the server.
loading: Tracks the loading state of data.
Data Fetching:

Uses axios to fetch data from the backend.
useEffect triggers data fetching on component mount and handles pagination.
Rendering:

FixedSizeList is used to render only the visible items to improve performance.
Conditional rendering based on loading state.
Backend
Server Setup (server.js):

Imports:

express: For setting up the server.
cors: For enabling CORS.
Data Generation:

generateItems(count): Function to create a large dataset.
Endpoints:

GET /api/items: Endpoint to fetch items with pagination. Simulates a network delay using setTimeout.
Running the Application
Frontend
Installation:

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install
Run Development Server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Backend
Installation:

bash
Copy code
cd server
npm install
Run Server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Testing
Unit Tests
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary testing libraries installed.

bash
Copy code
cd client
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
Configure Jest: Ensure jest.config.js is set up with necessary configurations, including transforming JSX files with Babel.

Run Tests:

bash
Copy code
npm test
Test Cases:

Loading State: Verifies that the loading text is displayed initially.
Rendering Items: Ensures that items are rendered after they are fetched.
Common Issues
Network Delay Handling:

Ensure that the simulated delay on the server does not exceed the timeout settings in the test environment.
Increase Jest timeout if necessary by adding jest.setTimeout(10000); in the setupTests.js or the specific test file.
Mocking Dependencies:

Ensure that axios is mocked correctly in the test files to simulate server responses.
React Testing Warnings:

Use act to wrap state updates in tests if encountering warnings related to unwrapped updates.
